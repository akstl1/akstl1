I'm a Sr Data & BI Analyst at Edward Jones, where I focus on analyzing operational data for general partners throughout the division with Power BI. I specialize in creating efficient data transformation sequences in Dataflows/Power Query for use across different reports, creating DAX measures to calculate trends, and visualizing data that in a meaningful way that our teams can act upon.

I also spearhead the firm's Power BI Champions by curating content for learning sessions, hosting weekly office hours, and serving as a mentor to several associates.

My background in engineering and project management allows me to navigate complex, ambiguous problems effectively and to collaborate with other areas with ease.

My portfolio focuses on analytics/data science topics that have piqued my interest and expanded my technical capabilities, with a strong emphasis on business impact.

In addition to Power BI, I am knowedgable in Python, SQL (Oracle, Snowflake, T), and R.
