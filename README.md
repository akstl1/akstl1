I’m Allan, and I'm an Assistant Project Manager and aspiring data professional. My portfolio focuses on interesting data science projects I've recently undertaken, with a strong emphasis on business impact. 

I have a background in Project Management, and have been learning Python so I can utilize programming to solve coding challenges and build machine learning models. I have also recently learned how to use Power BI, which I use to connect data in relational databases and develop dashboards and KPIs for my current employer.

I also post projects that I am working on to expand my knowledge of web development and dashboarding.
