I’m Allan, and I'm a Sr Data & Bi Analyst at Edward Jones. My portfolio focuses on interesting data science projects I've recently undertaken, with a strong emphasis on business impact, and programming projects to expand my technical capabilities.

I have a background in Project Management and analytics, and use Power BI to develop dashboards and KPIs for my current employer. I have been learning Python, Dash, and Django to solve coding challenges, build machine learning models, and develop websites/dashboards.
